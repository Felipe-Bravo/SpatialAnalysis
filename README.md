This repository includes the lab handouts and the datasets to complete the assignments.
Users have to install [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and QGIS (https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html)  while [RStudio](https://cran.r-project.org/) and [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) are recomended.
